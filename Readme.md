# Simplicial Representation Theory

A look at Simplicial Representation Theory.

We use Symmetries of local simplicial structures to define actions on
massive structures.

We are also interested in how finer grained descriptions of symmetries
(and their actions) relate to coarser grained descriptions.

We also interested in the analogy of a coarse grained representation of a
symmetry can be viewed as the symmetries of a "solid" (finer grained)
"object" together with the "motion" of its "centre of gravity".

The Newtonian/Relativistic limits should yield classical Representation
Theory.
